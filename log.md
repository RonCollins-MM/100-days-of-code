# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2021.

**Today's Progress**: Tweeted my committment statement of #100DaysOfCode. Made plans of what I'll start by working on for the next few weeks. I'm getting back into coding after being out of it for a while, and I'm getting back through doing Havard cs50 course on edx. Currently doing week 0's project which involves doing a project using Scratch. Will soon be getting into learning C.

**Thoughts:** Am super excited to be coding once more. Tbh, my passion and love for coding never really died and am super glad I've found a community of like minded people who enjoy coding just as much as I do. This is a great motivation booster.

### Day 1: May 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the logic and design of my Scratch project - a simple Ping-Pong game that can allow two players to play against each other or 1 player to play against AI. The difficulty of the AI can also be set to: Easy, Normal, Difficult and Hardcore. Actual coding and building will start tomorrow. Hope to be done in 2 weeks. Also, will continue to build more games/projects on Scratch as side projects.
**Thoughts** : Missed a day unfortunately due to Med school and fatigue. Felt more determined and refreshed today though. Will do everything in my power to never miss a day again. Overall, am happy to be back to coding :)

### Day 2: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Was able to implement upward and downward movement of the PlayerOne Sprite. Thinking of adding cool movement effects in the future. Learnt quite a bit on how Sprite works.
**Thoughts** : Posting this a day later(on the 27th) coz I ran out of time to update this block. I had missed the feeling of seeing code implement as you planned it to.

### Day 3: May 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the movement code using abstractions. Also have finally known what abstractions are, though I still need to read a bit more on them. Was also good to read about programming paradigms. Reminds me of the good ol' highschool days... Also, can't seem to make the Sprite stop when it touches the edge of the screen without exiting the whole program..

**Thoughts** : I hadn't missed the feeling of not having your code work as you plan it to LOL. Will figure it out though..

### Day 4: May 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to limit the Sprite movement to the upper and lower screen borders (Oh, the Joy!!). Implemented Player movements for player two as well. Looking next to introduce a ball and add ball mechanics.Once am done with the basic Ping-Pong (hopefully soon), I can start adding extra features e.g. Trick shot abilities, sounds and aesthetic effects.

**Thoughts** : Felt really good to crack that nut of movement. I learnt a key lesson today on patience and the importance of taking baby steps/small bites when approaching a large problem.

### Day 5: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Had a lot of trouble figuring out the ball mechanics. Had to seek some help from the Scratch Wiki page that proved super helpful. Will still have to polish up the ball physics by figuring out how the Math really works. This might involve me using some Nested Ifs. Otherwise, atm I have two functional ping pong player paddles as well as a functional ball. I think next I will polish up the ball physics. Then next I will work on adding audio and a backdrop. Once that is done, I can save it and maybe submit that project in case I never get time to work on it. Otherwise, I will continue to work on it until I finish it to what I envisioned.

**Thoughts** : Was really frustrating to get a lot of bugs and glitches that I could not even explain. Managed to work around them thought. I also had underestimated the power of Scratch - it is not as easy as I thought. I also have to learn to be disciplined to 1 hour a day and to learn to take a break even when am stuck on a glitch. Oh yeah, and I missed 2 days due to schoolwork. Glad to be back though.
