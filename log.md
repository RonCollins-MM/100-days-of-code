# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2021.

**Today's Progress**: Tweeted my committment statement of #100DaysOfCode. Made plans of what I'll start by working on for the next few weeks. I'm getting back into coding after being out of it for a while, and I'm getting back through doing Havard cs50 course on edx. Currently doing week 0's project which involves doing a project using Scratch. Will soon be getting into learning C.

**Thoughts:** Am super excited to be coding once more. Tbh, my passion and love for coding never really died and am super glad I've found a community of like minded people who enjoy coding just as much as I do. This is a great motivation booster.

### Day 1: May 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the logic and design of my Scratch project - a simple Ping-Pong game that can allow two players to play against each other or 1 player to play against AI. The difficulty of the AI can also be set to: Easy, Normal, Difficult and Hardcore. Actual coding and building will start tomorrow. Hope to be done in 2 weeks. Also, will continue to build more games/projects on Scratch as side projects.

**Thoughts** : Missed a day unfortunately due to Med school and fatigue. Felt more determined and refreshed today though. Will do everything in my power to never miss a day again. Overall, am happy to be back to coding :)
