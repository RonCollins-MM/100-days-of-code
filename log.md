**Project worked on**: 100-days-of-code layout

**Language(s)**: markdown

**Today's Progress**: Created a layout for the 100 days of code challenge - set up github and gathered resources.

**Thoughts:** It has been almost exactly 2 years since I last attempted this challenge.
Missed out on an opportunity to grow. Here is another go at it.
Hoping to hit 100 days this year. Aiming to master Python language. Let's do this!! üí™üèæ
