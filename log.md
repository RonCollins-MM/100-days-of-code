## Day 0: Sunday May 21, 2023

**Project worked on**: 100-days-of-code layout

**Language(s)**: markdown

**Today's Progress**: Created a layout for the 100 days of code challenge - set up github and gathered resources.

**Thoughts**: It has been almost exactly 2 years since I last attempted this challenge.
Missed out on an opportunity to grow. Here is another go at it.
Hoping to hit 100 days this year. Aiming to master Python language. Let's do this!! üí™üèæ

## Day 3: Wednesday May 24, 2023

**Project worked on**: Microblog flask app

**Language(s)**: Python

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a webform that captures data from user using `Flask-wtf`.
Also learnt:

1. A good way to store config settings for a flask app.
2. How to prevet [cross-site request forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks for webforms in flask.
3. How to handle `POST` request data in form views
4. How to use the `flash()` function in flask
5. How to perform field validation for flask forms
6. How to utilise error messages generated for forms with field validation
7. How to use the `url_for()` function in flask to dynamically generate urls to allow for salability

**Thoughts**: Learnt a lot of best practices today especially where scalability is key. Did my day early morning of next day because I was tired but that's okay

## Day 4: Thursday May 25, 2023

**Project worked on**: Microblog flask app

**Language(s)**: Python

**Today's Progress**: Created first model (User) plus added database support with migrations. Utilised `flask-sqlalchemy` and `flask-migrate` extensions.

**Thoughts**: working with databases is a core part of being a backend engineer. I am very careful to understand as much as I can as an aspiring backend dev. Did half the work today, will complete tomorrow.

## Day 5: Monday May 29, 2023

**Project worked on**: Microblog flask app

**Language(s)**: Python

**Today's Progress**: Learnt quite a bit regarding working with databases
using flask:

1. Creating a `One-to-Many` relationship between Models.
2. Creating a `flask shell` context.
3. Working with `flask shell` to manipulate objects in various ways:
    * Creating and deleting objects.
    * Running queries from the shell using SQLAlchemy ORM methods.
    * Committing and rollingback changes to db.

**Thoughts**: Had a 4 day hiatus - laptop battery needed replacement. Anyway,
glad to be back to the grind. I am determined to be Pythoneer some day.
Hopefully I can contribute to the Python core someday?

authentication. Also learnt how to:

1. Hash user passwords.
2. Add custom validators to forms.
3. Use `UserMixin` class to implement generic implementations of `flask-login`

**Thoughts**: The project is coming up nicely. Loving how my skill is slowly
but surely improving. Getting more comfortable with flask and it feels good.

## Day 7: Wednesday May 31, 2023

**Project worked on**: Microblog flask app

**Language(s)**: Python

**Today's Progress**: Implemented user profile page. Users can now view profile
page and edit it.

Key concepts learnt:

1. How to use `sub-templates` in Jinja2
2. Using external APIs in applications
3. A little bit about md5 hashing algorithm

**Thoughts**: This was tough today. Have a bug in my code that I can't really
figure out thought the code works well. Loving that I am getting more comfortable
with Python.
