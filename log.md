# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 23, 2021.

**Today's Progress**: Tweeted my committment statement of #100DaysOfCode. Made plans of what I'll start by working on for the next few weeks. I'm getting back into coding after being out of it for a while, and I'm getting back through doing Havard cs50 course on edx. Currently doing week 0's project which involves doing a project using Scratch. Will soon be getting into learning C.

**Thoughts:** Am super excited to be coding once more. Tbh, my passion and love for coding never really died and am super glad I've found a community of like minded people who enjoy coding just as much as I do. This is a great motivation booster.
